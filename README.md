> Status : In process of development

**TecSell** is a new classified ad marketplace project C2C

## **Problem Description:**

It is a fact that, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the purchase of computer-related products has become less accessible to the general public, for several reasons, we can mention the increase in the value of the dollar, for example. This phenomenon directly influenced the price of electronic products across the country. Another reason for the increased acceptance of remote means of work and teaching, such as Home-office and Online Classes, which resulted in a high demand for technological resources. According to Andr√© Braz, an economist at FGV, the trend is for product prices to remain high, albeit at a less intense pace, due to signs of continued high dollar.

With the increase in prices, it will not always be possible to buy a new device, and one of the alternatives is to look for a model in the second-hand market. Unfortunately, compared to other types of used cars, such as cars and real estate for example, the online used electronics market in Brazil proves to be little explored, causing buyers and sellers who seek, respectively, to acquire and advertise used equipment. submit to physical stores that perform this type of service, but often offer little varied products to buyers and offer visibility to sellers, charging high commission rates.

## **Proposed Solution:**

TecSell is a C2C niche classifieds site dedicated to buying and selling used electronics. Buyer and seller have complete control over their transactions, deciding together the best way to close the deal.
When entering the site, users already use the ads, use the search system and filters, however, before starting to sell or contacting sellers, users must register, informing data such as full name, cpf, telephone , email and password. After registering and logging in, the user will be able to access a sales option or proceed with a product negotiation.
When registering the ad, the seller user must add a title, a description for the product, a technical sheet, photos and value. The user must inform the category, subcategory and other characteristics of the product, such as brand, model, line, among others. After completing and saving the registration, the product will already be advertised on the platform. It is the seller's duty to inform the buyer of all the characteristics of the item offered, including warning of stains, scratches, signs of use or other problems.
The site will have a grouping of several products, distributed in their main categories (Computers, Laptops, Hardware, Tablets and Cell Phones) and subcategories, belonging to the main category. Ads can be filtered according to the location of the seller and the characteristics chosen by the buyer user, making the search much faster and more effective.
The buyer user can contact the seller through the chat available in the product advertisement. In this way, the forms of payment between them, which will not be the responsibility of the platform.
